### About
Outof is a minimal grocery list service for a single or shared household using [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) as their main communication. 

### Installation
Invite [@iamoutof_bot](https://t.me/iamoutof_bot) to a channel where you or your household communicate.

### Usage

### Commands
Outof consists of 3 commands:
- `/outof item, item...` - Add new items that you have run outof.
  - Example: `/outof candles, garlic, wooden stakes` 
- `/generate` - Generates a list containing all items, with a random name to use when you go shopping, responding with a link to the list.
- `/list` - Display a list of all current items you are outof.


#### List
A list has two options for every item. One option is to mark it as **purchased**. It will then be removed from the main list and the current list.
The other option is to mark it as **not purchased** in this shopping session. It will be removed from the current list but not removed from the main list. When a list is generated the next time, the item will still be present.

When a list no longer has any items, it will be removed. At the end of every shopping session, the list should be empty.
